# Practical NLP in PyTorch
This repository is here to provide tutorials (and a record of my work) regarding practical NLP in PyTorch. The code here is complementary to [my blog](http://mlexplained.com/).
I will be gradually updating this repository as I learn new tools and write new posts.

## How to run the notebooks
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
These tutorials assume PyTorch version 1.0.0

## Available Tutorials
- Using allennlp
    - Basics
    - Using BERT and ELMo
    
- Using fastai
    - Using BERT

- Models from scratch
    - Implementing an LSTM from scratch
    - Implementing the Transformer from scratch
    - Implementing the Transformer XL from scratch

## Tutorials I am Planning to Work On
