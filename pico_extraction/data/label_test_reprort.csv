"six cycles of CHOP-R therapy and six cycles CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib, followed by acalabrutinib maintenance",,,"Eligible patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL-type RS are randomised between six cycles of CHOP-R therapy and six cycles CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib, followed by acalabrutinib maintenance.",,,"Transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) type Richter's syndrome (RS) carries a dismal prognosis. Standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy for de novo RS is inadequate with median survival of less than one year. Patients are frequently elderly or have co-morbidities limiting dose-intense chemotherapy. Treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) RS and RS emerging after CLL-directed therapy represent urgent unmet clinical needs. Agents targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) deliver improved outcomes for patients with high-risk CLL and expand effective treatments to frailer patients. Acalabrutinib is an oral, second-generation BTK inhibitor with a favourable toxicity profile and demonstrated activity in CLL and B-cell lymphomas. Combination of acalabrutinib with standard-of-care CHOP-R chemoimmunotherapy offers a sound rationale to test in a prospective trial for de novo RS. The prospective multicentre STELLAR study is designed in two elements, consisting of a randomised study to evaluate the safety and activity of CHOP-R chemoimmunotherapy in combination with acalabrutinib in newly diagnosed RS and single-arm studies of novel agents for other RS patient cohorts. Eligible patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL-type RS are randomised between six cycles of CHOP-R therapy and six cycles CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib, followed by acalabrutinib maintenance. The primary endpoint of the randomised component is progression free survival (PFS). Cohort 1 enrols RS patients with progressive disease following chemoimmunotherapy for acalabrutinib monotherapy. Patients with RS diagnosed while on ibrutinib may enrol in Cohort 2, a single-arm study of CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib. The primary endpoint for the single-arm studies is overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints for all cohorts are overall survival (OS), quality of life and proportion of patients proceeding to stem cell transplantation. The study will be accompanied by exploratory analysis of the mutational landscape of RS and the relationship between dynamic changes in sequential circulating tumour DNA samples and clinical outcomes. The STELLAR randomised trial evaluates the role of CHOP-R plus acalabrutinib in newly diagnosed RS patients. The single-arm platform studies enable the incorporation of promising novel therapies into the protocol. The STELLAR study has potential to identify novel biomarkers of treatment response in this high-risk malignancy. EudraCT: 2017-004401-40 , registered on the 31-Oct-2017.

We aimed to compare Supraflex with the standard of care, Xience, an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer coating, regarding clinical outcomes with a randomised trial in an all-comer population. We did a prospective, randomised, single-blind, multicentre study (TALENT) across 23 centres in Europe (the Netherlands, Poland, the UK, Spain, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Italy). Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had one or more coronary artery stenosis of 50% or greater in a native coronary artery, saphenous venous graft, or arterial bypass conduit, and had a reference vessel diameter of 2·25-4·50 mm. Patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in an all-comer manner. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to implantation of either a sirolimus-eluting stent with a biodegradable polymer coating and ultra-thin struts (Supraflex) or an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer coating (Xience). Randomisation was done by local investigators by use of a web-based software with random blocks according to centre. The primary endpoint was a non-inferiority comparison of a device-oriented composite endpoint-cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically indicated target lesion revascularisation-between groups at 12 months after the procedure, assessed in an intention-to-treat population. On assumption of 1-year composite endpoint prevalence of 8·3%, a margin of 4·0% was defined for non-inferiority of the Supraflex group compared with the Xience group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02870140. Between Oct 21, 2016, and July 3, 2017, 1435 patients with 1046 lesions were randomly assigned to Supraflex, of whom 720 received the index procedure, and 715 patients with 1030 lesions were assigned to Xience, all receiving the index procedure. At 12 months, the primary endpoint had occurred in 35 patients (4·9 %) in the Supraflex group and in 37 patients (5·3%) in the Xience group (absolute difference -0·3% [one-sided 95% upper confidence bound 1·6%], p <0·0001). Definite or probable stent thrombosis prevalence, a safety indicator, was low in both groups and did not differ between them. The Supraflex stent was non-inferior to the Xience stent for a device-oriented composite clinical endpoint at 12 months in an all-comer population. Supraflex seems a safe and effective alternative drug-eluting stent to other stents in clinical practice.

usual care or exercise group,randomized to either the usual care or exercise group,,Participants were randomized to either the usual care or exercise group.,Participants were randomized to either the usual care or exercise group.,,"The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is a valid method for predicting the 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Higher FRS is reported in patients with early-stage breast cancer who are overweight than in healthy, age-matched women, but whether exercise reduces FRS in this patient population is unclear. To examine the effects of a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on the FRS in women with early-stage breast cancer and with overweight condition or obesity. This single-center, prospective randomized clinical trial included 100 women with stage I to III breast cancer who were sedentary, with overweight condition or obesity (body mass index of ≥25.0 or body fat of ≥30%), and completed cancer treatment within 6 months prior to enrollment. Participants were randomized to either the usual care or exercise group. Differences in mean changes for outcomes were evaluated using mixed-model repeated-measures analyses. Data were collected from August 1, 2012, through July 1, 2017. Data analysis, which followed the intention-to-treat approach, was performed from May 24 to October 2, 2018. The exercise group underwent supervised aerobic and resistance exercise sessions thrice weekly for 16 weeks. The FRS was calculated for each participant using preset points for each of the 6 FRS categories: age, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes presence, and smoking status. In total, 100 women were randomized to either the exercise group (n = 50) or usual care group (n = 50). Of these women, 55 (55%) were of Hispanic white race/ethnicity and the mean (SD) age was 53.5 (10.4) years. The mean (SD) total FRS scores postintervention were 2.0 (1.5) in the exercise group and 13.0 (3.0) in the usual care group. The postintervention FRS was significantly reduced in the exercise group compared with the usual care group (mean, -9.5; 95% CI, -13.0 to -6.0), which corresponds to an 11% (95% CI, -15.0 to -5.0) decrease on the FRS-predicted 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease. A 16-week supervised aerobic and resistance exercise intervention appeared to reduce the FRS-predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease in women with early-stage breast cancer with overweight condition or obesity.

one-to-one fashion to low (63 mm Hg) or high (77 mm Hg) mean arterial blood pressure target,,,Sixty unconscious patients with sustained return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA will be randomly assigned in a one-to-one fashion to low (63 mm Hg) or high (77 mm Hg) mean arterial blood pressure target.,,,"Neurological injuries remain the leading cause of death in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Adequate blood pressure is of paramount importance to optimize cerebral perfusion and to minimize secondary brain injury. Markers measuring global cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation and reflecting the metabolic variations after successful resuscitation are needed to assist a more individualized post-resuscitation care. Currently, no technique is available for bedside evaluation of global cerebral energy state, and until now blood pressure targets have been based on limited clinical evidence. Recent experimental and clinical studies indicate that it might be possible to evaluate cerebral oxidative metabolism from measuring the lactate-to-pyruvate (LP) ratio of the draining venous blood. In this study, jugular bulb microdialysis and immediate bedside biochemical analysis are introduced as new diagnostic tools to evaluate the effect of higher mean arterial blood pressure on global cerebral metabolism and the degree of cellular damage after OHCA. This is a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, superiority trial. Sixty unconscious patients with sustained return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA will be randomly assigned in a one-to-one fashion to low (63 mm Hg) or high (77 mm Hg) mean arterial blood pressure target. The primary end-point will be a difference in mean LP ratio within 48 h between blood pressure groups. Secondary end-points are (1) association between LP ratio and all-cause intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and (2) association between LP ratio and survival to hospital discharge with poor neurological function. Markers measuring cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation and reflecting the metabolic changes after successful resuscitation are urgently needed to enable a more personalized post-resuscitation care and prognostication. Jugular bulb microdialysis may provide a reliable global estimate of cerebral metabolic state and can be implemented as an entirely new and less invasive diagnostic tool for ICU patients after OHCA and has implications for early prognosis and treatment.

It may be appropriate to include older children, and to provide protection for more than 4 months. We evaluated the effectiveness of SMC using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine given over 5 months to children under 10 years of age in Saraya district in south-east Senegal in 2011. Twenty-four villages, including 2,301 children aged 3-59 months and 2,245 aged 5-9 years, were randomised to receive SMC with community case management (CCM) (SMC villages) or CCM alone (control villages). In all villages, community health workers (CHWs) were trained to treat malaria cases with artemisinin combination therapy after testing with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In SMC villages, CHWs administered SMC to children aged 3 months to 9 years once a month for 5 months. The study was conducted from 27 July to 31 December 2011. The primary outcome was malaria (fever or history of fever with a positive RDT). The prevalence of anaemia and parasitaemia was measured in a survey at the end of the transmission season. Molecular markers associated with resistance to SMC drugs were analysed in samples from incident malaria cases and from children with parasitaemia in the survey. SMC was well tolerated with no serious adverse reactions. There were 1,472 RDT-confirmed malaria cases in the control villages and 270 in the SMC villages. Among children under 5 years of age, the rate difference was 110.8/1,000/month (95% CI 64.7, 156.8; p < 0.001) and among children 5-9 years of age, 101.3/1,000/month (95% CI 66.7, 136.0; p < 0.001). The mean haemoglobin concentration at the end of the transmission season was higher in SMC than control villages, by 6.5 g/l (95% CI 2.0, 11; p = 0.007) among children under 5 years of age, and by 5.2 g/l (95% CI 0.4, 9.9; p = 0.035) among children 5-9 years of age. The prevalence of parasitaemia was 18% in children under 5 years of age and 25% in children 5-9 years of age in the control villages, and 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively, in these 2 age groups in the SMC villages, with prevalence differences of 12.5% (95% CI 6.8%, 18.2%; p < 0.001) in children under 5 years of age and 19.3% (95% CI 8.3%, 30.2%; p < 0.001) in children 5-9 years of age. The pfdhps-540E mutation associated with clinical resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was found in 0.8% of samples from malaria cases but not in the final survey. Twelve children died in the control group and 14 in the SMC group, a rate difference of 0.096/1,000 child-months (95% CI 0.99, 1.18; p = 0.895). Limitations of this study include that we were not able to obtain blood smears for microscopy for all suspected malaria cases, such that we had to rely on RDTs for confirmation, which may have included false positives. In this study SMC for children under 10 years of age given over 5 months was feasible, well tolerated, and effective in preventing malaria episodes, and reduced the prevalence of parasitaemia and anaemia.

After the16-week intervention, an increase in serum NE and reduction in 5-HT were observed in the acupuncture group (P=0.028 and P=0.023, respectively). The serum level of GABA decreased in both groups after the interventions (both P<0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the levels of any neurotransmitters (p>0.05). After EA treatment, SAS and SDS scores were decreased in the acupuncture group (P=0.007 and P=0.027, respectively) and were lower than those of the control group (P=0.003 and P=0.004, respectively). The SF-36 domain scores for mental health, vitality, social functioning, general health and health transition, the total CHQOL scores, and the infertility problems and body hair domains of the PCOSQOL improved significantly after EA (P<0.05).

Bleeding after transbronchial biopsy is the most important procedure- associated complication and may be life threatening. This study addresses the risk of bleeding of transbronchial cryobiopsy. In this prospective, randomized, controlled multicentre study 359 patients with interstitial lung disease requiring diagnostic bronchoscopic tissue sampling were included. Both conventional transbronchial forceps biopsy and transbronchial cryobiopsy were undertaken in each patient. The sequence of the procedures was randomized. Bleeding severity was evaluated semi-quantitatively as ""no bleeding"", ""mild"" (suction alone), ""moderate"" (additional intervention) or ""severe"" (prolonged monitoring necessary or fatal outcome), for each intervention. In 359 patients atotal of 1160 cryobiopsies and 1302 forceps biopsies were performed. Bleeding was observed after forceps biopsy in 173 patients (48.2%) and after cryobiopsy in 261 patients (72.7%). Bleeding was significantly greater in the cryobiopsy group (cryobiopsy/forceps biopsy: no bleeding 27.3%/51.8%; mild 56.5%/44.0%; moderate 15.0%/4.2%; severe 1.2%/0%; p < 0.001). The rate of clinically relevant bleeding (moderate or severe) was higher after the cryobiopsy procedures compared to the forceps biopsies (16.2% vs. 4.2%, p < 0.05). No fatal bleeding complications occurred. Compared to transbronchial forceps biopsy, transbronchial cryobiopsy was associated with an increased risk of bleeding which is of clinical relevance. Therefore training and additional precautions for bleeding control should be considered.

These conditions are driven by relatively high levels of inflammation persisting on ART compared with uninfected individuals. Chronic inflammation also contributes to HIV persistence during ART. Cannabis when taken orally may represent a way to reduce inflammation and strengthen immune responses. Before planning large interventional studies, it is important to ensure that cannabis taken orally is safe and well tolerated in people living with HIV. We propose to conduct a pilot randomised trial to examine the safety and tolerability of cannabis oils containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) consumed orally in people living with HIV. We will also measure inflammatory markers, markers of HIV persistence in peripheral blood cells and changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome.

Safety and tolerability of these capsules will be assessed through haematological, hepatic and renal blood tests, face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. Proportions of participants without any signs of significant toxicity (grades 0-2 scores on the WHO toxicity scale) and who complete the study, as well as scores on quality of life and mood will be examined using descriptive statistics.

In this open-label, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial, PCI-eligible patients were assigned to receive either 1 of 2 strategies: PCI or no PCI for the qualifying de novo CTO lesion with the option for PCI of obstructive non-CTO lesions at the discretion of the operator. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Because of slow recruitment, the trial was stopped before completion of the 1284 planned enrollments. Between March 2010 and September 2016, 834 patients were randomly assigned to the CTO-PCI (n=417) or no CTO-PCI (n=398) strategy. Among the patients assigned to the no CTO-PCI strategy, 78 (19.6%) crossed over to receive staged CTO-PCI within 3 days of randomization. The overall CTO-PCI success rate was 90.6%. Serious nonfatal complications associated with CTO-PCI occurred in 3 patients (1 stroke, 1 cardiac tamponade, and 1 patient with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia induced by intracoronary thrombus). Approximately half of the patients in each group underwent PCI for an average of 1.3 non-CTO lesions, resulting in a comparable residual SYNTAX score (Synergy Between PCI With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery; 3.7±5.4 versus 4.0±5.9, P=0.42) confined to non-CTO vessels.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pistachio intake on telomere length and other cellular aging-related parameters of glucose and insulin metabolism. Forty-nine prediabetic subjects were included in a randomized crossover clinical trial. Subjects consumed a pistachio-supplemented diet (PD, 50 E% [energy percentage] carbohydrates and 33 E% fat, including 57 g pistachios/d) and an isocaloric control diet (CD, 55 E% carbohydrates and 30 E% fat) for 4 mo each, separated by a 2-wk washout period. DNA oxidation was evaluated by DNA damage (via 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine). Leucocyte telomere length and gene expression related to either oxidation, telomere maintenance or glucose, and insulin metabolism were analyzed by multiplexed quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction after the dietary intervention. Compared with the CD, the PD reduced oxidative damage to DNA (mean: -3.5%; 95% CI: -8.07%, 1.05%; P = 0.009).

Interestingly, changes in TERT expression were negatively correlated to changes in fasting plasma glucose concentrations and in the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. Chronic pistachio consumption reduces oxidative damage to DNA and increases the gene expression of some telomere-associated genes. Lessening oxidative damage to DNA and telomerase expression through diet may represent an intriguing way to promote healthspan in humans, reversing certain deleterious metabolic consequences of prediabetes.

Their use can offer logistical and feasibility advantages in low-resource settings. Antiviral AV2  is a mixture of natural essential oils (eugenol, carvone, nerolidol, geraniol) in olive oil, and has a broad spectrum anti-viral activity. In a phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT), AV2  proved effective in reducing the size of cervical lesions associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the efficacy of AV2 over placebo in the topical treatment of HPV-associated cervical lesions. Women aged 25 years and older were included in this phase 3 RCT. Cytology screening, HPV testing and visual inspection of the cervix with 5% acetic acid (VIA) were performed on all participants. VIA-positive women were randomized to one of two groups to receive treatment by either AV2® or placebo. The treatment consisted of 2 puffs of spray of the investigational drug directed to the cervix. Participants were subjected to repeat examinations two months and six months later for assessment of outcomes. The primary outcome was the change of lesions on VIA at 2 months after application of the investigational drug. Secondary outcomes were: HPV clearance and cytologic regression at 2 months and 6 months, and number of participants with AEs. A total 327 VIA positive women were randomized in two groups (168 in AV2 group and 159 in placebo group). Women in the 2 groups were similar with respect to baseline demographics and clinical characteristics. At 2 months, regression of lesions on VIA was observed in 127 (89.4%) out of 142 women in AV2 group compared to 120 (91.6%) out of 131 women in placebo group (P = 0.7). On cytology, regression of lesions occurred in 14 (56%) out of 25 women in the AV2 arm and in 13 (48.1) out of 27 women in the placebo arm (p = 0.7), and HPV clearance rates were 34.1% and 35% in AV2 group and placebo group respectively (p = 0.8). At 6 months cytologic regression was observed in 64.7% of women in AV2 group and 45.8% in placebo group (p = 0.2), while HPV clearance occurred in 11 (51.9%) out of 17 women in AV2 arm versus 11 (34.4%) in placebo arm (p = 0.3).Some local side effects (burning, itching, irritation) were similarly noted in the 2 groups (p-values = 0.169, 0.623 and 0.172 respectively) but they were mild and transitory. A topical application of AV2 onto the cervix can induce the regression of cervical precancerous lesions, but its efficacy does not significantly differ with that of placebo. The discrepancy between the expected and the recorded sample size as well as the huge number of lost to follow-up probably impeded the power of analyses, which could be one of the reasons for the lack of difference seen between AV2 and placebo. Further evaluation of the effects of AV2 with different diagnostic methods and treatment regimen and arms is warranted.

On CPB, the patient's mean arterial pressure was targeted to be greater than that patient's lower limit of autoregulation. In the control group, mean arterial pressure targets were determined according to institutional practice. The main outcome was any incidence of delirium on postoperative days 1 through 4, as adjudicated by a consensus expert panel. Among the 199 participants in this study, mean (SD) age was 70.3 (7.5) years and 150 (75.4%) were male. One hundred sixty-two (81.4%) were white, 26 (13.1%) were black, and 11 (5.5%) were of other race. Of 103 patients randomized to usual care, 94 were analyzed, and of 102 patients randomized to the intervention 105 were analyzed. Excluding 5 patients with coma, delirium occurred in 48 of the 91 patients (53%) in the usual care group compared with 39 of the 103 patients (38%) in the intervention group (P = .04). The odds of delirium were reduced by 45% in patients randomized to the autoregulation group (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). The results of this study suggest that optimizing mean arterial pressure to be greater than the individual patient's lower limit of cerebral autoregulation during CPB may reduce the incidence of delirium after cardiac surgery, but further study is needed.

Prospective, randomized, parallel-group controlled trial. Sixty-seven seven-year-old children with a Class II occlusion were included in the study. The children were randomized into two equal-size groups in 1:1 ratio by sealed-envelope randomization. The early group (EG, n = 33) was treated between T0 and T1 (26 months), right after eruption of the first maxillary molars. The late group (LG, n = 34) was treated between T1 and T2 (24 months). The children were treated with CH until normal Class I occlusion on first molars was achieved. Impressions for dental casts were taken from all participants at T0, T1, and T2. Blinding was applicable for outcome assessors. Changes in dental cast measurements were compared between the groups and genders using t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance. Of the children, 56 completed the study. The maxillary arch length and the transversal changes between the upper canines and upper first molars were significantly increased in EG at T0-T1 (P < 0.001). At T2, the transversal dimension between the upper first molars was larger (P < 0.05), and in the lower arch the mandibular arch length (P < 0.05) and the transversal dimension between the lower first molars (P < 0.01) were increased in EG males compared to LG males. No harms were encountered. The male gender benefits most from early timing of the CH treatment, showing larger dimensions at the end of the follow-up.

Secondary objectives comprised the evaluation of patients' adherence to pain education program, the description of pain intensity, pain relief, analgesic adherence and pain emotional impact. Educational dimension of the program will be evaluated through the patients' acquisition of knowledge and skills about their pain and treatment as well as their self-efficacy to participate actively in pain management. The patient's feeling of pain changes will be measured. Finally, the satisfaction of participants and educators will be reported. We hypothetise active involvement of patients in TPE will lead to an improved pain management compared to standard care.

GA with or without HCQ.,,,Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GA with or without HCQ.,,,"Autophagy is a mechanism of treatment resistance to chemotherapy that has a role in the maintenance of pancreatic cancer. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) is an inhibitor of autophagy that inhibits the fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome. To determine whether HCQ improves overall survival at 1 year in combination with gemcitabine hydrochloride and nab-paclitaxel (GA) among patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Open-label, phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted between March 18, 2013, and November 16, 2017, at the University of Pennsylvania, HonorHealth, and The Johns Hopkins University among 112 patients with previously untreated metastatic or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate marrow and organ function. All efficacy analyses were performed for the intention-to-treat population. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GA with or without HCQ. All patients received standard doses of GA, and those randomized to receive HCQ were treated continuously with 600 mg orally twice daily. Overall survival at 1 year. A total of 112 patients (45 women and 67 men; median age, 65 years; range, 43-86 years) were enrolled; 55 were randomized to receive GA plus HCQ, and 57 to receive GA. Overall survival at 12 months was 41% (95% CI, 27%-53%) in the HCQ group and 49% (95% CI, 35%-61%) in the non-HCQ group. Median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.0-9.3 months) in the HCQ group and 6.4 months (95% CI, 4.5-7.6 months) in the non-HCQ group. Median overall survival was 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.0-14.2 months) in the HCQ group and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3-15.5 months) in the non-HCQ group. Overall response rate was 38.2% (n = 21) in the HCQ group and 21.1% (n = 12) in the non-HCQ group (P = .047). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events that differed between the HCQ and non-HCQ groups were neutropenia (23 of 54 [42.6%] vs 12 of 53 [22.6%]), anemia (2 of 54 [3.7%] vs 9 of 53 [17.0%]), fatigue (4 of 54 [7.4%] vs 0), nausea (5 of 54 [9.3%] vs 0), peripheral neuropathy (7 of 54 [13.0%] vs 3 of 53 [5.7%]), visual changes (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0), and neuropsychiatric symptoms (3 of 54 [5.6%] vs 0). The addition of HCQ to block autophagy did not improve the primary end point of overall survival at 12 months. These data do not support the routine use of GA plus HCQ for metastatic pancreatic cancer in the absence of a biomarker. However, improvement seen in the overall response rate with HCQ may indicate a role for HCQ in the locally advanced setting, where tumor response may permit resection.

Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the benefit-risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). KEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system.

Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival estimates at 6-months were 82·0% (95% CI 73·2-88·1) versus 85·0% (76·8-90·5; hazard ratio [HR] 1·22; 95% CI 0·67-2·22; p=0·75). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).

To test the effectiveness of training community therapists in An Individualized Mental Health Intervention for ASD (AIM HI) on challenging behaviors across 18 months among children with ASD and identify moderators and mediators of any intervention effects. Cluster randomized trial conducted in 29 publicly funded outpatient and school-based mental health programs in southern California from 2012 to 2017. Programs were randomized to receive immediate AIM HI training or provide usual care followed by receipt of AIM HI training. Therapist participants were recruited from enrolled programs, and child participants were recruited from participant therapists' caseloads. Data were analyzed from 202 children with ASD who were aged 5 to 13 years. The AIM HI protocol is a package of parent-mediated and child-focused strategies aimed to reduce challenging behaviors in children with ASD who are 5 to 13 years old. It was designed for delivery in publicly funded mental health services based on a systematic assessment of therapist training needs and child clinical needs. The therapist training and consultation process takes approximately 6 months and includes an introductory workshop, 11 structured consultation meetings as the therapist delivers AIM HI with a current client, and case-specific performance feedback from trainers. Child participants were assessed for challenging behaviors using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) and Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) Competing Problem Behaviors scales based on parent report at baseline and at 6-month intervals for 18 months. Outcomes were analyzed using intent-to-treat models. In total, 202 children with ASD (mean [SD] age, 9.1 [2.4] years; 170 [84.2%] male; 121 [59.9%] Latinx) were eligible, enrolled, and included in the analyses. Statistically significant group by time interactions for the ECBI Intensity (B = -0.38; P = .02) and ECBI Problem (B = -1.00; P = .005) scales were observed, with significantly larger decreases in ECBI Intensity scores in the AIM HI group (B = -1.36; P < .001) relative to the usual care group (B = -0.98; P < .001) and a significantly larger decrease in ECBI Problem scores in the AIM HI group (B = -1.22; P < .001) relative to the usual care group (B = -0.20; P = .29). Therapist fidelity moderated these intervention effects.

Patients (N = 504) were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m  every 3 weeks), stratified by performance status, tumor histology, and tumor programmed death ligand 1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival, and safety. OS was significantly improved with nivolumab (n = 338) versus docetaxel (n = 166); median OS (95% confidence interval): 12.0 (10.4-14.0) versus 9.6 (7.6-11.2) months, respectively; hazard ratio (97.7% confidence interval): 0.68 (0.52-0.90); p = 0.0006. Objective response rate was 17% with nivolumab versus 4% with docetaxel; median duration of response was not reached versus 5.3 months. Minimum follow-up was 8.8 months. The frequency of grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events was 10% with nivolumab and 48% with docetaxel. This is the first phase III study in a predominantly Chinese population reporting results with a programmed death 1 inhibitor.

A randomised, controlled and patient-blinded study. Single-centre trial, study period from June 2016 to February 2017. Seventy-four infants undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients were allocated randomly into either ultrasound-guided group (group US) or palpation-guided group (group P) (each n=37) according to the technique applied for radial arterial catheterisation. All arterial catheterisations were performed by one of two experienced anaesthesiologists based on group assignment and were recorded on video. The primary endpoint was the first-pass success. The number of attempts and total duration of the procedure until successful catheterisation were also analysed. The first-pass success rate was significantly higher in the group US than in the group P (68 vs. 38%, P = 0.019).

,,,Participants will be randomized to receive intraoperative anesthetic maintenance with either sevoflurane or propofol.,,,"Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass are at an increased risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications, potentially leading to excess morbidity and mortality. It is likely that pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury during cardiopulmonary bypass is a major contributor to perioperative lung injury. Therefore, interventions that can minimize IR injury would be valuable in reducing the excess burden of this potentially preventable disease process. Volatile anesthetics including sevoflurane have been shown in both preclinical and human trials to effectively limit pulmonary inflammation in a number of settings including ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, this finding has not yet been demonstrated in the cardiac surgery population. The Anesthetics to Prevent Lung Injury in Cardiac Surgery (APLICS) trial is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating whether sevoflurane anesthetic maintenance can modulate pulmonary inflammation occurring during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and whether this potential effect can translate to a reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications. APLICS is a prospective RCT of adult cardiac surgical patients. Participants will be randomized to receive intraoperative anesthetic maintenance with either sevoflurane or propofol. Patients in both groups will be ventilated according to protocols intended to minimize the influences of ventilator-induced lung injury and hyperoxia. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood sampling will take place after anesthetic induction and 2-4 h after pulmonary reperfusion. The primary outcome is a difference between groups in the degree of post-bypass lung inflammation, defined by BAL concentrations of TNFα. Secondary outcomes will include differences in additional relevant BAL and systemic inflammatory markers and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. APLICS investigates whether anesthetic choice can influence lung inflammation and pulmonary outcomes following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A positive result from this trial would add to the growing body of evidence describing the lung protective properties of the volatile anesthetics and potentially reduce unnecessary morbidity for cardiac surgery patients.

Los pacientes en el grupo control recibieron los cuidados postoperatorios habituales. El criterio de valoración principal fue la LOS total (estancia postoperatoria más reingreso/estancia en urgencias/días de observación) a los 30 días. Los criterios de valoración secundarios incluyeron los resultados referidos por los pacientes medidos por los cuestionarios EQ-5D-5L, el Cuestionario Breve del Dolor (Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) y un cuestionario de satisfacción.

The cerebellum is known to be strongly implicated in the functional reorganization of motor networks in patients with stroke, especially for gait and balance functions. To determine whether cerebellar intermittent θ-burst stimulation (CRB-iTBS) can improve balance and gait functions in patients with hemiparesis due to stroke. This randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled phase IIa trial investigated efficacy and safety of a 3-week treatment of CRB-iTBS coupled with physiotherapy in promoting gait and balance recovery in patients with stroke. Thirty-six patients with consecutive ischemic chronic stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery with hemiparesis were recruited from a neuro-rehabilitation hospital. Participants were screened and enrolled from March 2013 to June 2017. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with CRB-iTBS or sham iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side immediately before physiotherapy daily during 3 weeks. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in change from baseline in the Berg Balance Scale. Secondary exploratory measures included the between-group difference in change from baseline in Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale, Barthel Index, and locomotion assessment with gait analysis and cortical activity measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation in combination with electroencephalogram. A total of 34 patients (mean [SD] age, 64 [11.3] years; 13 women [38.2%]) completed the study. Patients treated with CRB-iTBS, but not with sham iTBS, showed an improvement of gait and balance functions, as revealed by a pronounced increase in the mean (SE) Berg Balance Scale score (baseline: 34.5 [3.4]; 3 weeks after treatment: 43.4 [2.6]; 3 weeks after the end of treatment: 47.5 [1.8]; P < .001). No overall treatment-associated differences were noted in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (mean [SE], baseline: 163.8 [6.8]; 3 weeks after treatment: 171.1 [7.2]; 3 weeks after the end of treatment: 173.5 [6.9]; P > .05) and Barthel Index scores (mean [SE], baseline: 71.1 [4.92]; 3 weeks after treatment: 88.8 [2.1]; 3 weeks after the end of treatment: 92.2 [2.4]; P > .05).

We did the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 ACE trial at 22 specialist cancer centres in China. Eligible patients were postmenopausal women (aged ≥60 years or aged <60 years if their serum follicle-stimulating hormone and oestradiol concentrations were within postmenopausal ranges) with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, whose disease had relapsed or progressed after at least one endocrine therapy (either in advanced or metastatic or adjuvant setting), and who had at least one measurable lesion, adequate organ function, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and adequate haematological and biochemical parameters. Endocrine therapy did not have to be the most recent therapy before randomisation, but recurrence or progression after the most recent therapy was a prerequisite. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) by a dynamic randomisation scheme via an interactive web-response system to receive 30 mg oral tucidinostat or placebo twice weekly. All patients in both groups also received 25 mg oral exemestane daily. Randomisation was stratified according to the presence of visceral metastases (yes vs no).

Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of pelvic infection, which is an important complication of this surgery, particularly in low-resource countries. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial investigating whether antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery to complete a spontaneous abortion would reduce pelvic infection among women and adolescents in low-resource countries. We randomly assigned patients to a single preoperative dose of 400 mg of oral doxycycline and 400 mg of oral metronidazole or identical placebos. The primary outcome was pelvic infection within 14 days after surgery. Pelvic infection was defined by the presence of two or more of four clinical features (purulent vaginal discharge, pyrexia, uterine tenderness, and leukocytosis) or by the presence of one of these features and the clinically identified need to administer antibiotics. The definition of pelvic infection was changed before the unblinding of the data; the original strict definition was two or more of the clinical features, without reference to the administration of antibiotics. We enrolled 3412 patients in Malawi, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda. A total of 1705 patients were assigned to receive antibiotics and 1707 to receive placebo. The risk of pelvic infection was 4.1% (68 of 1676 pregnancies) in the antibiotics group and 5.3% (90 of 1684 pregnancies) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.04; P = 0.09). Pelvic infection according to original strict criteria was diagnosed in 1.5% (26 of 1700 pregnancies) and 2.6% (44 of 1704 pregnancies), respectively (risk ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.96). There were no significant between-group differences in adverse events. Antibiotic prophylaxis before miscarriage surgery did not result in a significantly lower risk of pelvic infection, as defined by pragmatic broad criteria, than placebo.

polyethylene glycol plus SIM or polyethylene glycol,randomly assigned to 2 different preparations: polyethylene glycol plus SIM or polyethylene glycol,,Patients were randomly assigned to 2 different preparations: polyethylene glycol plus SIM or polyethylene glycol.,Patients were randomly assigned to 2 different preparations: polyethylene glycol plus SIM or polyethylene glycol.,,"Combining simethicone (SIM) with a colon preparation agent has been shown to improve mucosal visibility during screening colonoscopy, but its effect on the adenoma detection rate (ADR) remains unclear. SIM is commonly used through the endoscope to eliminate bubbles during endoscopy. However, this practice recently has been associated with endoscope-transmitted infections. Our aims were to determine the role of SIM added to a polyethylene glycol preparation on the ADR, procedure times, colon preparation, and intraprocedural use of SIM. This was a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, clinical trial of patients undergoing screening colonoscopy. Patients with a high risk of colorectal cancer were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 different preparations: polyethylene glycol plus SIM or polyethylene glycol. Two endoscopists blinded to patient preparation regimens scored its quality by using the Boston Bowel Preparation scale (BBPS) and the bubble scale. Interobserver agreement was calculated. The polyp detection rate, ADR, intraprocedural use of SIM, cecal intubation time, and withdrawal time were recorded. For study purposes, cecal intubation time and withdrawal time were combined to determine the effective procedure time. No significant difference between the polyethylene glycol plus SIM and polyethylene glycol arms was seen regarding the ADR (33.3% vs 38.8%; P = .881) and effective procedure time (759.3 ± 253.1 seconds vs 800.2 ± 459.6 seconds; P = .373), respectively. Intraprocedural use of SIM as well as the bubble scale score were significantly lower in the polyethylene glycol plus SIM arm (1.6% vs 48.9%; P ≤ .05) and (0.1 vs 2.1; P ≤ .05), respectively. Conversely, no difference was found in the BBPS scores. The interobserver agreement for both scores was strong (bubble scale score kappa = .537; P < .05; BBPS score kappa = .184; P <.05). Adding SIM to a polyethylene glycol preparation did not improve the ADR or effective procedure time. Nevertheless, it resulted in lower bubble scale scores, and more importantly, in less intraprocedural use of SIM. This simple and inexpensive intervention may have the potential to reduce the risk of endoscope-transmitted infections.

Some large human cohort studies have shown an association between general anaesthesia at a young age and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, but these studies are prone to bias. Others have found no evidence for an association. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in early infancy affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this international, assessor-masked, equivalence, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, we recruited infants of less than 60 weeks' postmenstrual age who were born at more than 26 weeks' gestation and were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, without previous exposure to general anaesthesia or risk factors for neurological injury. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a web-based randomisation service to receive either awake-regional anaesthetic or sevoflurane-based general anaesthetic. Anaesthetists were aware of group allocation, but individuals administering the neurodevelopmental assessments were not. Parents were informed of their infants group allocation upon request, but were told to mask this information from assessors. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI-III), at 5 years of age. The primary analysis was done on a per-protocol basis, adjusted for gestational age at birth and country, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. An intention-to-treat analysis was also done. A difference in means of 5 points was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This completed trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 4023 infants were screened and 722 were randomly allocated: 363 (50%) to the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 359 (50%) to the general anaesthesia group. There were 74 protocol violations in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and two in the general anaesthesia group. Primary outcome data for the per-protocol analysis were obtained from 205 children in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 242 in the general anaesthesia group. The median duration of general anaesthesia was 54 min (IQR 41-70). The mean FSIQ score was 99·08 (SD 18·35) in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 98·97 (19·66) in the general anaesthesia group, with a difference in means (awake-regional anaesthesia minus general anaesthesia) of 0·23 (95% CI -2·59 to 3·06), providing strong evidence of equivalence.

,,,,,,"In the context of opioid-sparing perioperative management, there is still little evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of interfascial thoracic blocks.

After general anesthesia, patients were randomly allocated to either conventional analgesia (control group, n=30) or single-injection serratus block with L-bupivacaine 0.25% 30mL (study group, n=30). First 24-hour total morphine consumption (primary outcome), pain scores at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours, time-to-first opioid rescue analgesia, and adverse effects were recorded. Median 24 hours' opioid dose was greater in the control group (median difference 9 mg (95% CI 4 to 14.5 mg); p<0.001). Proportional odds model showed that the study group has a lower probability of receiving opioid drugs (OR=0.26 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.68); p<0.001), while mastectomies have a higher probability of receiving them (OR=4.11 (95% CI 1.25 to 13.58); p=0.002).

Participants in a screening program are usually motivated healthy individuals in which a good tolerability is important to improve adherence to potential surveillance colonoscopies. Our aim was to assess whether or not a normocaloric low-fiber diet followed the day before a screening colonoscopy compromises the efficacy of bowel cleansing and may improve the tolerability of bowel preparation. This is a randomized, endoscopist-blinded, noninferiority clinical trial. The study was conducted at a tertiary care center. A total of 276 consecutive participants of the Barcelona colorectal cancer screening program were included. Participants were randomly assigned to a clear-liquid diet or a normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before the colonoscopy. Both groups received 4 L of polyethylene glycol in a split-dose regimen. Primary outcome was the adequate bowel preparation rate measured with the Boston bowel preparation scale. Secondary outcomes included tolerability, fluid-intake perception, hunger, side effects, and acceptability. Participants in both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Adequate bowel preparation was achieved in 89.1% vs 95.7% in clear-liquid diet and low-fiber diet groups, showing not only noninferiority, but also superiority (p = 0.04). Low-fiber diet participants reported less fluid-intake perception (p = 0.04) and less hunger (p = 0.006), with no differences in bloating or nausea. The single-center design of the study could limit the external validity of the results. The present findings may not be comparable to other clinical settings.

We aim to examine whether NF training can decrease cognitive disorders, targeting memory, attention functions and brain electrical activity in elderly patients with MCI. In this single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol, we will investigate the effects of two NF training protocols on cognitive performances and on brain electrical activity. Sixty MCI patients will be assigned either to an intervention program or to psycho-pedagogical care as a control condition. Participants in the intervention group will attend 30 sessions of sensorimotor/delta-ratio NF training or beta1/theta-ratio NF training. Neuropsychological assessment, questionnaires and electroencephalography (EEG) assessment parameters will be used as dependent variables in three periods: at baseline (T0), immediately after the last NF training session at 4 months (T1) and at 3-month follow-up (T2). The primary outcome will be the change in attention measured with the Trail Making Test B. Secondary outcome will be the changes in cognitive performance and in EEG activities.

Although pharmaceutical interventions still play an essential role in therapeutic measures, limitations, including effects that are delayed for weeks, are noteworthy. Antidepressants with rapid efficacy and acceptable tolerance have been investigated for many years; rapid antidepressant effects and promising clinical applications have been obtained with intravenous and oral scopolamine. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of repeated intramuscular scopolamine as an add-on treatment to escitalopram. This is a single-center, saline-controlled, double-blind, three-armed, randomized trial. Sixty-six participants diagnosed with MDD will be recruited at Beijing Anding Hospital and randomly assigned to one of three groups: a high-dose intramuscular scopolamine augmentation group; a low-dose intramuscular scopolamine augmentation group; and a placebo control group. Our primary endpoint is improvement in the 17-Item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) score from the baseline (at least a 20% reduction). Prespecified secondary endpoints include response rates and remission rates as well as changes in the total or subscale scores between the baseline and week 4. This study will provide the first insight regarding the rapid antidepressant efficacy and tolerability of an intramuscular scopolamine add-on to the usual treatment in Chinese MDD patients. The first discussion concerns whether augmentation can accelerate early antidepressant efficacy. A pilot study of intramuscular scopolamine is performed. The limitations of this study include its small sample size and it being a single-center study, suggesting the need for further confirmation with trials enrolling larger populations. The study protocol and all related materials have been approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Beijing Anding Hospital (No. 2016-106, Beijing, China).

Sixty-one patients eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to receive a 6-month program of weekly aerobic exercises associated with nutritional counseling (n = 41) or usual care with nutritional counseling (n = 20, one withdrawal). The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients compliant with two weekly supervised sessions and their overall adherence (i.e., proportion of supervised and unsupervised sessions completed versus planned sessions). Ten percent of patients in the intervention group were compliant with the two weekly supervised sessions for 6 months, but the overall median adherence rate was 85% of supervised and non-supervised sessions completed. Non-adherence was mainly due to intrinsic reasons (medical, organizational, psychological barriers). Adherence was positively associated with education and baseline PA level and inversely associated with baseline weight and tumor grade. No statistically significant benefits were observed in the intervention group, even if overall PA level and body composition improved and anthropometrics were maintained over time (p < 0.05). Overall, there was good adherence with the 6-month exercise program during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, despite poor compliance to twice-weekly supervised sessions.

Individuals with obesity typically show increased knee valgus angles combined with an increased step width. Accompanying muscular dysfunctions impede their ability to compensate for these alterations, especially in the frontal plane. To date, no studies are available, which evaluated the potential effects of an exercise program (EP) in reducing these unfavorable biomechanical changes. Is a 12-week EP, which includes hip abductor and knee extensor strength exercises and fosters dynamic knee alignment, effective in positively altering gait biomechanics in children and adolescents with obesity? This study was a randomized controlled trial having children and adolescents with obesity assigned to an EP (n = 19) or control (n = 16) group. Pain, self-rated knee function, muscle strength and 3D gait analysis during walking and stair climbing were evaluated. Results indicate that the EP was able to increase muscular strength especially in the hip abductors. In addition, children from the EP group walked with less maximum hip adduction and reduced pelvic drop during weight acceptance at follow-up. No changes were present in self-rated knee function, pain or discomfort. Even though effects were small, results indicate that an EP is an effective short-term possibility to counteract the progressive development of biomechanical malalignments of the lower extremity. Clinical parameters indicated that the program was feasible. Nonetheless, low adherence highlights the need to develop more attractive programs. CLINICAL TRIALS REG.

***antibiotics in the treatment of CT-scan confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis.",,"Based on epidemiological and clinical data acute appendicitis can present either as uncomplicated (70-80%) or complicated (20-30%) disease. Recent studies have shown that antibiotic therapy is both safe and cost-effective for a CT-scan confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. However, based on the study protocols to ensure patient safety, these randomised studies used mainly broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics requiring additional hospital resources and prolonged hospital stay. As we now know that antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis is feasible and safe, further studies evaluating optimisation of the antibiotic treatment regarding both antibiotic spectrum and shorter hospital stay are needed to evaluate antibiotics as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis. APPAC II trial is a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing per oral (p.o.) antibiotic monotherapy with intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy followed by p.o. antibiotics in the treatment of CT-scan confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Adult patients with CT-scan diagnosed uncomplicated acute appendicitis will be enrolled in nine Finnish hospitals. The intended sample size is 552 patients. Primary endpoint is the success of the randomised treatment, defined as resolution of acute appendicitis resulting in discharge from the hospital without the need for surgical intervention and no recurrent appendicitis during one-year follow-up. Secondary endpoints include post-intervention complications, late recurrence of acute appendicitis after one year, duration of hospital stay, pain, quality of life, sick leave and treatment costs. Primary endpoint will be evaluated in two stages: point estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for both groups and proportion difference between groups with 95% CI will be calculated and evaluated based on 6 percentage point non-inferiority margin. To our knowledge, APPAC II trial is the first randomised controlled trial comparing per oral antibiotic monotherapy with intravenous antibiotic therapy continued by per oral antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. The APPAC II trial aims to add clinical evidence on the debated role of antibiotics as the first-line treatment for a CT-confirmed uncomplicated acute appendicitis as well as to optimise the non-operative treatment for uncomplicated acute appendicitis.

the efficacy of an Enhanced Standard Care condition (n=110) compared to an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention condition,,,This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Standard Care condition (n=110) compared to an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention condition (n=110) to increase viral suppression among YLH aged 12-24 years with established infection (not acutely infected).,,,"Among youth living with HIV (YLH) aged 12-24 years who have health care in the United States, only 30% to 40% are virally suppressed. YLH must achieve viral suppression in order to reduce the probability of infecting others as well as increasing the length and quality of their own life. This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Standard Care condition (n=110) compared to an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention condition (n=110) to increase viral suppression among YLH aged 12-24 years with established infection (not acutely infected). YLH (N=220) who are not virally suppressed will be identified at homeless shelters, health clinics, and gay-identified community-based organizations in Los Angeles, CA, and New Orleans, LA. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. YLH will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: Enhanced Standard Care, which includes standard clinical care plus an automated messaging and monitoring intervention (AMMI), or an Enhanced Stepped Care, which includes three levels of intervention (AMMI, Peer Support via social media plus AMMI, or Coaching plus Peer Support and AMMI). The primary outcome is viral suppression of HIV, and YLH will be assessed at 4-month intervals for 24 months. For the Enhanced Stepped Care intervention group, those who do not achieve viral suppression (via blood draw, viral load<200 copies/mL) at any 4-month assessment will ""step up"" to the next level of intervention. Secondary outcomes will be retention in care, antiretroviral therapy adherence, alcohol use, substance use, sexual behavior, and mental health symptoms. Recruitment for this study began in June 2017 and is ongoing. We estimate data collection to be completed by the end of 2020. This is the first known application of an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention model for YLH. By providing the lowest level of intervention needed to achieve viral suppression, this model has the potential to be a cost-effective method of helping YLH achieve viral suppression and improve their quality of life.

Patients in the DEPO cohort consumed fewer hourly narcotics on postoperative day 0 (5.3 vs 6.3 oral morphine equivalents/hour, p = 0.034). However, no differences in acute postoperative pain or total narcotics consumption were observed between groups. Preoperative VAS leg scores were statistically different between cohorts (p = 0.027). However, preoperative ODI and VAS back scores did not differ between groups. Additionally, DEPO and NODEPO groups experienced similar improvements in PROs at all postoperative time points.CONCLUSIONSLocal depomedrol use did not lead to decreases in acute postoperative pain or narcotics consumption after MIS TLIF. Additionally, local depomedrol was not associated with postoperative improvements in PROs. The findings of this randomized trial suggest that surgical and clinical outcomes following MIS TLIF may not be impacted by intraoperative application of depomedrol.Clinical trial registration no.: NCT03308084 (clinicaltrials.gov).",30497132,"['Vincent Cheng', 'Luke McGuinness']"

Two clinical trials in older adults have shown spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) results in similar or small improvements relative to medical care; however, the effectiveness of adding SMT or rehabilitative exercise to home exercise is unclear. We conducted a randomized clinical trial assessing the comparative effectiveness of adding SMT or supervised rehabilitative exercise to home exercise in adults 65 or older with sub-acute or chronic LBP. Treatments were provided over 12-weeks and self-report outcomes were collected at 4, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The primary outcome was pain severity. Secondary outcomes included back disability, health status, medication use, satisfaction with care, and global improvement. Linear mixed models were used to analyze outcomes. The primary analysis included longitudinal outcomes in the short (week 4-12) and long-term (week 4-52). An omnibus test assessing differences across all groups over the year was used to control for multiplicity. Secondary analyses included outcomes at each time point and responder analyses. This study was funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration. 241 participants were randomized and 230 (95%) provided complete primary outcome data. The primary analysis showed group differences in pain over the one-year were small and not statistically significant. Pain severity was reduced by 30 to 40% after treatment in all 3 groups with the largest difference (eight percentage points) favoring SMT and home exercise over home exercise alone. Group differences at other time points ranged from 0 to 6 percentage points with no consistent pattern favoring one treatment. One-year post-treatment pain reductions diminished in all three groups. Secondary self-report outcomes followed a similar pattern with no important group differences, except satisfaction with care, where the two combination groups were consistently superior to home exercise alone. Adding spinal manipulation or supervised rehabilitative exercise to home exercise alone does not appear to improve pain or disability in the short- or long-term for older adults with chronic low back pain, but did enhance satisfaction with care.

There is no consensus on the optimal neoadjuvant approach. A pilot study from our institution has shown improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NACRT). The present randomised phase III trial is designed to compare NACRT with NACT alone and will test the superiority of chemoradiation in terms of tumour downstaging and improvement in OS. Patients with biopsy-proven locally advanced GBC (T3-4) with predefined clinical-radiological features will be randomised to the gemcitabine-based chemotherapy-alone arm or the chemoradiation arm. Patients with resectable disease or with distant metastases will be excluded. The primary end point of the study is to compare OS between the two arms. The secondary end point was to compare PFS, R0 resection rates, acute and late toxicity, postoperative complications and quality of life between the two study arms. The trial is designed to detect an improvement in median OS by 5.5 months in the study arm (11 months in the control group, HR of 0.7) with 80.0% power at a 0.05 significance level.

The present pilot study tested the efficacy and feasibility of group Metacognitive Grief Therapy (MCGT) designed specifically for prolonged grief symptomatology to reduce the psychological distress and impaired function resulting from bereavement. Twenty-two bereaved adult participants with prolonged grief symptomatology were randomised to a wait-list control (n=10) or an intervention condition (n=12) with a 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The wait-list control group was offered treatment after the post-test assessment. Participants attended six group MCGT sessions that ran for 2 hours per week. A primary outcome measure of prolonged grief symptomatology and secondary outcome measures of depression, anxiety, rumination, metacognitive beliefs and quality of life were taken pretreatment and post-treatment for both groups and at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up for the intervention group. A Generalised Linear Mixed Model was used to assess treatment efficacy. Post-treatment intent-to-treat analyses showed MCGT reduced prolonged grief symptomatology (Cohen's d=1.7), depression (d=1.3), anxiety (d=0.8), stress (d=1.0), rumination (d=0.9) and increased quality of life (d=0.6), and these effects were maintained at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. No prepost between-group differences were found in metacognitive beliefs. However, a large significant effect was identified at the 3-month and 6-month follow-ups (d=1.0). The results show promise for the utility of group MCGT for reducing psychological distress and promoting quality of life. Additionally, the results underscore the need for a full randomised controlled trial of group MCGT, which may be an important addition to the treatment armamentarium available to support people with prolonged grief.

EHR alert was randomized to half,,,The EHR alert was randomized to half of the teams on the general medicine service.,,,"Physicians frequently use cardiac monitoring, or telemetry, beyond the duration recommended by published practice standards, resulting in ""alarm fatigue"" and excess cost. Prior studies have demonstrated an association between multicomponent quality improvement interventions and safe reduction of telemetry duration. To determine if a single-component intervention, a targeted electronic health record (EHR) alert, could achieve similar gains to multicomponent interventions and safely reduce unnecessary monitoring. This cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted between November 2016 and May 2017 on the general medicine service of the Division of Hospital Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center and included physicians of 12 inpatient medical teams (6 intervention, 6 control). The EHR alert was randomized to half of the teams on the general medicine service. The alert displayed during daytime hours when physicians attempted to place an order for patients not in the intensive care unit whose telemetry order duration exceeded the recommended duration for a given indication. The primary outcome was telemetry monitoring hours per hospitalization, which was measured using time-stamped orders data from the EHR database. Physician responses to the alert were collected using EHR reporting tools. The potential adverse outcomes of rapid-response calls and medical emergency events were measured by counting the notes documenting these events in the EHR. Of the 1021 patients included in this study, in the intervention arm, there was a mean (SD) age of 64.5 (18.9) and 215 (45%) were women; in the control arm, there was a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (19.1) and 249 (46%) were women. The 12 teams were stratified to 8 house-staff teams and 4 hospitalist teams, with 499 hospitalizations analyzed in the intervention arm and 567 hospitalizations analyzed in the control arm. The alert prompted a significant reduction in telemetry monitoring duration (-8.7 hours per hospitalization; 95% CI, -14.1 to -3.5 hours; P = .001) with no significant change in rapid-response calls or medical emergency events. The most common physician response to the alert was to discontinue telemetry monitoring (62% of 200 alerts). A targeted EHR alert can safely and successfully reduce cardiac monitoring by prompting discontinuation when appropriate. This single-component electronic intervention is less resource intensive than typical multicomponent interventions that include human resources.

to compare postoperative HRQoL after open and laparoscopic liver resection,,,The aim of this study was to compare postoperative HRQoL after open and laparoscopic liver resection.,,,"Most treatments for cancer cause a decline in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limiting this decline is a universal goal for healthcare providers. Using minimally invasive instead of open surgical techniques might be one way to achieve this. The aim of this study was to compare postoperative HRQoL after open and laparoscopic liver resection. This was a predefined substudy of an RCT comparing open with laparoscopic liver resection. Patients with colorectal liver metastases were assigned randomly to open or laparoscopic parenchyma-sparing liver resection. HRQoL was assessed with the Short Form 36 questionnaire at baseline, and 1 and 4 months after surgery. A total of 280 patients were randomized, of whom 273 underwent surgery (129 laparoscopic, 144 open); 682 questionnaires (83.3 per cent) were available for analysis. One month after surgery, patients in the laparoscopic surgery group reported reduced scores in two HRQoL domains (physical functioning and role physical), whereas those in the open surgery group reported reduced scores in five domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality and social functioning). Four months after surgery, HRQoL scores in the laparoscopic group had returned to preoperative levels, whereas patients in the open group reported reduced scores for two domains (role physical and general health). The between-group difference was statistically significant in favour of laparoscopy for four domains after 1 month (role physical, bodily pain, vitality and social functioning) and for one domain after 4 months (role physical). Patients assigned to laparoscopic liver surgery reported better postoperative HRQoL than those assigned to open liver surgery. For role limitations caused by physical health problems, patients in the laparoscopic group reported better scores up to 4 months after surgery.

La mayoría de los tratamientos para el cáncer causan una disminución de la calidad de vida relacionada con la salud (health-related quality of life, HRQoL) de los pacientes. Limitar este declive es un objetivo universal para los proveedores de atención médica. El uso de técnicas quirúrgicas mínimamente invasivas en lugar de abiertas podría ser una forma de lograrlo. El objetivo de este estudio fue comparar la HRQoL postoperatoria después de la resección hepática abierta y laparoscópica. MÉTODOS: Se trata de un subestudio predefinido de un ensayo aleatorizado y controlado que comparó la resección hepática abierta con la laparoscópica. Los pacientes con metástasis hepáticas colorrectales se asignaron aleatoriamente al grupo de resección hepática con preservación de parénquima por vía abierta o por vía laparoscópica. La HRQoL se evaluó con el cuestionario abreviado SF-36 en el momento basal y al cabo de 1 y 4 meses después de la cirugía. Un total de 280 pacientes fueron aleatorizados, de los cuales 273 se sometieron a cirugía (129 = laparoscópica, 144 = abierta) y hubo 682 cuestionarios (83%) disponibles para el análisis. Un mes después de la cirugía, los pacientes del grupo de cirugía laparoscópica presentaron puntuaciones reducidas en dos items de HRQoL (función física y rol físico), mientras que los pacientes del grupo de cirugía abierta presentaron puntuaciones reducidas en cinco items (función física, rol físico, dolor corporal, vitalidad y función social). Cuatro meses después de la cirugía, el grupo de cirugía laparoscópica había vuelto a los niveles preoperatorios de la HRQoL, mientras que los pacientes del grupo de cirugía abierta presentaron puntuaciones reducidas para dos items (función física y salud general). La diferencia entre los grupos fue estadísticamente significativa a favor de la laparoscopia para cuatro items después de un mes de la cirugía (rol físico, dolor corporal, vitalidad y función social) y para un ítem (rol físico) después de cuatro meses. CONCLUSIÓN: Los pacientes asignados a cirugía hepática laparoscópica presentaron mejor HRQoL postoperatoria que los pacientes asignados a cirugía hepática abierta. Para las limitaciones de roles causadas por problemas físicos de salud, los pacientes de cirugía laparoscópica presentaron mejores puntuaciones a los cuatro meses tras la intervención quirúrgica.",31322735,['Luke McGuinness']

Enrolled VTE-PRO participants self-inject either low-molecular weight heparin or a saline placebo for 30 days postoperatively. Study outcomes include feasibility, incidence of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism-related morbidity and mortality. Initial analyses demonstrated low rates of accrual and retention for the VTE-PRO pilot. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to develop a knowledge translation intervention to improve VTE-PRO pilot trial accrual and retention. Eligible participants were surveyed to identify the barriers to VTE-PRO participation. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to categorize these barriers. Barriers were mapped to the capabilities, opportunities, and behavior (COM-B) behavioral change wheel to identify potential interventions to support trial accrual and retention. The resulting knowledge translation intervention was titled Inform, Remind, Involve and Support to improve Accrual and Retention (IRIS-AR). Key informant interviews with patients were held to refine and confirm the validity of identified barriers and perceived acceptability of the proposed IRIS-AR intervention. Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this study. The resulting intervention included: information booklets and counseling sessions to identify unique participant challenges to trial participation (Inform); daily reminders to administer injections (Remind); involvement of family/caregivers in study processes (Involve); and leverage of an existing home-care nursing program to provide injection support when needed (Support). Twenty-six key informant participants were interviewed. The most common barriers to trial participation included lack of social support and fear of needle injection. Participants generally supported use of information booklets, involvement of family/caregivers, and support by a home-care nursing program; however, not all supported the use of daily reminders. Developed using theory and integrated knowledge translation, the IRIS-AR presents a patient-centered intervention that leverages existing programs to promote trial engagement. The proposed strategy can likely be adapted to improve compliance with other patient-directed interventions. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02334007 .

Households were eligible if they had at least one adult patient who had been diagnosed and prescribed medicines for one of the non-communicable diseases targeted by the programme: hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes, asthma, or breast cancer. Primary outcomes were availability and price of portfolio medicines at health facilities, irrespective of brand; and availability of medicines at patient households. Impacts were estimated with intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02773095). On March 8, 2016, we randomly assigned eight clusters to intervention (four clusters; 74 health facilities; 342 patients) or control (four clusters; 63 health facilities; 297 patients). 69 intervention and 58 control health facilities, and 306 intervention and 265 control patients were evaluated after a 15 month intervention period (last visit February 28, 2018). Novartis Access significantly increased the availability of amlodipine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·84, 95% CI 1·10 to 7·37; p=0·031) and metformin (aOR 4·78, 95% CI 1·44 to 15·86; p=0·011) at health facilities, but did not affect the availability of portfolio medicines overall (adjusted β [aβ] 0·05, 95% CI -0·01 to 0·10; p=0·096) or their price (aβ 0·48, 95% CI -1·12 to 0·72; p=0·500). The programme did not affect medicine availability at patient households (aOR 0·83, 95% CI 0·44 to 1·57; p=0·569). Novartis Access had little effect in its first year in Kenya. Access programmes operate within complex health systems and reducing the wholesale price of medicines might not always or immediately translate to improved patient access. The evidence generated by this study will inform Novartis's efforts to improve their programme going forward. The study also contributes to the public evidence base on strategies for improving access to medicines globally.

A total of 229 patients were randomized to PF, and 227 patients were randomized to TF. At 3 years postoperatively, the median (interquartile range) esophageal acid exposure was reduced from 14.6% (9.8-21.9) to 1.8% (0.7-4.4) after PF and from 16.0% (10.4-22.7) to 2.5% (0.8-6.8) after TF (P = .31). Likewise, reflux symptoms were equally and effectively controlled. Early postoperative dysphagia (6 weeks) was common in both groups but then decreased toward normality. A small but statistically significant difference in favor of PF was noted in the mean (SD) scoring of dysphagia for liquids at 6 weeks (PF, 1.6 [0.9]; TF, 1.9 [1.3]; P = .01) and for solid food at 12 months (PF, 1.3 [1.0]; TF, 1.9 [1.4]; P < .001) and 24 months (PF, 1.3 [0.9]; TF, 1.7 [1.2]; P = .001). Quality of life was reduced before surgery but increased to normal values after surgery and remained so over 5-year follow-up, with no difference between the groups. The results from this randomized clinical trial suggest that although PF and TF could be recommended for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, PF might be superior by inducing less dysphagia.

Integrase inhibitors lead to significantly more rapid declines in HIV viral load (VL) than all other ART classes.

Limitations of the study include limited clinical, radiological, and/or microbiological information for some participants, reflecting available services at the centres, and lack of baseline genotypes.

Medical record review after patients' death demonstrated that a significantly higher proportion of intervention patients had a documented discussion compared with controls (96% vs 79%, P = .005) and intervention conversations occurred a median of 2.4 months earlier (median, 143 days vs 71 days, P < .001). Conversation documentation for intervention patients was significantly more comprehensive and patient centered, with a greater focus on values or goals (89% vs 44%, P < .001), prognosis or illness understanding (91% vs 48%, P < .001), and life-sustaining treatment preferences (63% vs 32%, P = .004). Documentation about end-of-life care planning did not differ between arms (80% intervention vs 68% control, P = .08). Significantly more intervention patients had documentation that was accessible in the EMR (61% vs 11%, P < .001).

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) has demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of using a programme called 'MiQuit' to text SHS support to pregnant women who smoke. Another pilot RCT has shown that it would be feasible to run a larger, multi-centre trial within the UK National Health Service (NHS).

specific rehabilitation to usual care,,,"NA-CONTROL is a single-centre, randomised controlled trial comparing specific rehabilitation to usual care in NA.",,,"Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is a distinct peripheral neurological disorder of the brachial plexus with a yearly incidence of 1/1000, which is characterised by acute severe upper extremity pain. Weakness of the stabilising shoulder muscles in the acute phase leads to compensatory strategies and abnormal motor control of the shoulder - scapular dyskinesia. Despite peripheral nerve recovery, scapular dyskinesia often persists, leading to debilitating residual complaints including pain and fatigue. Evidence suggests that persistent scapular dyskinesia in NA may result from maladaptive cerebral neuroplasticity, altering motor planning. Currently there is no proven effective causative treatment for the residual symptoms in NA. Moreover, the role of cerebral mechanisms in persistent scapular dyskinesia remains unclear. NA-CONTROL is a single-centre, randomised controlled trial comparing specific rehabilitation to usual care in NA. The rehabilitation programme combines relearning of motor control, targeting cerebral mechanisms, with self-management strategies. Fifty patients will be included. Patients are recruited through the Radboud university medical center Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Patients with a (suspected) diagnosis of NA, with lateralized symptoms and scapular dyskinesia in the right upper extremity, who are 18 years or older and not in the acute phase can be included. The primary outcome is the Shoulder Rating Questionnaire score, which measures functional capability of the upper extremity. Secondary clinical outcomes include measures of pain, fatigue, participation, reachable workspace, muscle strength and quality of life. In addition, motor planning is assessed with first-person motor imagery and functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a sub-study the patients are compared to 25 healthy participants, to determine the involvement of cerebral mechanisms. This will enable interpretation of cerebral changes associated with the rehabilitation programme and functional impairments in NA. NA-CONTROL is the first randomised trial to investigate the effect of specific rehabilitation on residual complaints in NA. It also is the first study into the cerebral mechanisms that might underlie persistent scapular dyskinesia in NA. It thus may aid the further development of mechanism-based interventions for disturbed motor control in NA and in other peripheral neurological disorders. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03441347 .

After 20 weeks of treatment, the mean absolute changes from baseline in 6-minute walk test distance were 0.2 m (95% CI, -12.1 to 12.4 m) for the placebo group; 19.4 m (95% CI, -10.8 to 49.7 m) for the 5 mg of neladenoson group; 29.4 m (95% CI, 3.0 to 55.8 m) for 10 mg of neladenoson group; 13.8 m (95% CI, -2.3 to 29.8 m) for 20 mg of neladenoson group; 16.3 m (95% CI, -1.1 to 33.6 m) for 30 mg of neladenoson group; and 13.0 m (95% CI, -5.9 to 31.9 m) for 40 mg of neladenoson group. Because none of the neladenoson groups achieved the clinically relevant 40-m increase in 6-minute walk test distance from baseline, an optimal dose of neladenoson was not identified. There was no significant dose-response relationship for the change in 6-minute walk test distance among the 5 different dose-response models (P = .05 for Emax; P = .18 for quadratic; P = .21 for sigmoidal Emax 1; P = .39 for linear; and P = .52 for sigmoidal Emax 2). Serious adverse events were similar among the neladenoson groups (61/229 [26.6%]) and the placebo group (21/76 [27.6%]). Among patients with HFpEF, there was no significant dose-response relationship detected for neladenoson with regard to the change in exercise capacity from baseline to 20 weeks. In light of these findings, novel approaches will be needed if further development of neladenoson for the treatment of patients with HFpEF is pursued.

TARE group (chemotherapy with TARE in place of the second chemotherapy infusion and subsequent resumption of chemotherapy) or the control group (chemotherapy alone).,,,Patients were randomized 1:1 to the TARE group (chemotherapy with TARE in place of the second chemotherapy infusion and subsequent resumption of chemotherapy) or the control group (chemotherapy alone).,,,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer-related death. Up to approximately 70% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have metastases to the liver at initial diagnosis. Second-line systemic treatment in mCRC can prolong survival after development of disease progression during or after first-line treatment and in those who are intolerant to first-line treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with TheraSphere yttrium-90 ( Y) glass microspheres combined with second-line therapy in patients with mCRC of the liver who had disease progression during or after first-line chemotherapy. EPOCH is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial being conducted at up to 100 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Eligible patients have mCRC of the liver and disease progression after first-line chemotherapy with either an oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based regimen and are eligible for second-line chemotherapy with the alternate regimen. Patients were randomized 1:1 to the TARE group (chemotherapy with TARE in place of the second chemotherapy infusion and subsequent resumption of chemotherapy) or the control group (chemotherapy alone). The addition of targeted agents is permitted. The primary end points are progression-free survival and hepatic progression-free survival. The study objective will be considered achieved if at least one primary end point is statistically significant. Secondary end points are overall survival, time to symptomatic progression defined as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score of 2 or higher, objective response rate, disease control rate, quality-of-life assessment by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal Cancer questionnaire, and adverse events. The study is an adaptive trial, comprising a group sequential design with 2 interim analyses with a planned maximum of 420 patients. The study is designed to detect a 2.5-month increase in median progression-free survival, from 6 months in the control group to 8.5 months in the TARE group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71), and a 3.5-month increase in median hepatic progression-free survival time, from 6.5 months in the control group to 10 months in the TARE group (HR 0.65). On the basis of simulations, the power to detect the target difference in either progression-free survival or hepatic progression-free survival is >90%, and the power to detect the target difference in each end point alone is >80%. Patient enrollment ended in October 2018. The first interim analysis in June 2018 resulted in continuation of the study without any changes. The EPOCH study may contribute toward the establishment of the role of combination therapy with TARE and oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of mCRC of the liver.

PCT and LUS-guided antibiotic therapy or to PCT only-guided therapy or to usual care.,,,GPs are randomized either to PCT and LUS-guided antibiotic therapy or to PCT only-guided therapy or to usual care.,,,"A minority of patients presenting with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) to their general practitioner (GP) have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and require antibiotic therapy. Identifying them is challenging, because of overlapping symptomatology and low diagnostic performance of chest X-ray. Procalcitonin (PCT) can be safely used to decide on antibiotic prescription in patients with LRTI. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is effective in detecting lung consolidation in pneumonia and might compensate for the lack of specificity of PCT. We hypothesize that combining PCT and LUS, available as point-of care tests (POCT), might reduce antibiotic prescription in LRTIs without impacting patient safety in the primary care setting. This is a three-arm pragmatic cluster randomized controlled clinical trial. GPs are randomized either to PCT and LUS-guided antibiotic therapy or to PCT only-guided therapy or to usual care. Consecutive adult patients with an acute cough due to a respiratory infection will be screened and included if they present a clinical pneumonia as defined by European guidelines. Exclusion criteria are previous antibiotics for the current episode, working diagnosis of sinusitis, severe underlying lung disease, severe immunosuppression, hospital admission, pregnancy, inability to provide informed consent and unavailability of the GP. Patients will fill in a 28 day-symptom diary and will be contacted by phone on days 7 and 28. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients prescribed any antibiotic up to day 28. Secondary outcomes include clinical failure by day 7 (death, admission to hospital, absence of amelioration or worsening of relevant symptoms) and by day 28, duration of restricted daily activities, episode duration as defined by symptom score, number of medical visits, number of days with side effects due to antibiotics and a composite outcome combining death, admission to hospital and complications due to LRTI by day 28. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and of processes in the clinic using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach will also be conducted. Our intervention targets only patients with clinically suspected CAP who have a higher pretest probability of definite pneumonia. The intervention will not substitute clinical assessment but completes it by introducing new easy-to-perform tests.

post-discharge usual care or to care that provided TFU,,,Patients (n = 288) were randomly allocated to either post-discharge usual care or to care that provided TFU and access to a 24/7 hotline after AVR.,,,"Thirty-day all-cause readmissions are high after aortic valve replacement (AVR). We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a structured telephone follow-up (TFU) and a 24/7 hotline on reducing 30-day all-cause readmission (30-DACR) after AVR, on reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and on improving perceived health state. A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients (n = 288) were randomly allocated to either post-discharge usual care or to care that provided TFU and access to a 24/7 hotline after AVR. Ancillary endpoints were time-to-event (readmission), proportion of avoidable versus unavoidable readmissions after AVR, and predictors of 30-DACR after AVR. 30-DACR was 22.3%. The structured TFU and 24/7 hotline intervention failed to reduce 30-DACR rates after AVR (P = 0.274). Symptoms of anxiety were significantly reduced 30 days after surgery (P = 0.031), an effect that did not persist one year after surgery (P = 0.108). Most readmissions occurred before 15 days post-discharge, and 75% of them were deemed to be unavoidable. Pleural drainage before hospital discharge (P = 0.027) and symptoms of anxiety before surgery (P = 0.003) were predictors of 30-DACR after AVR. The TFU and 24/7 hotline had no effect on reducing 30-DACR after AVR. However, we did measure reduced symptoms of anxiety the first month after AVR. Anxiety reduction appeared to be an important target for intervention, because we found it to be a risk factor for readmission. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of interventions to prevent avoidable unplanned readmissions. ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02522663.",31387822,['Vincent Cheng']

Pre-operatively, the POSE (12.4 ± 2.9 vs 12.8 ± 2.6, p = 0.33, for the preserved side and the resected side, respectively) and LKES (5.0 ± 1.0 vs 4.8 ± 1.2, p = 0.33) scores were similar between sides. During follow up, resection was associated with more crusting at 1 month following ESS (1.0 ± 0.7 vs 0.4 ± 0.6, p = 0.02). There was a small, but statistically significant, difference between the nasal cavities at 3 months, where the resected side showed better endoscopic appearance (2.0 ± 2.2 vs 3.4 ± 2.8, p = 0.01). No difference was found at 6 months. Frontal sinus scores were similar between sides at 6 months (0.7 ± 0.5 vs 0.7 ± 0.5, p = 1.00).

A total of 88 patients were randomly allocated to the control group (CG) and intervention group (IG). Three evaluations were performed: pre-brachytherapy, post-brachytherapy and follow-up of 3 months. The CG received standard guidance from the health team while the IG was instructed to use VD for 3 months. The dimensions of the vaginal canal (main outcome) were defined by the length of the vagina (centimetres), width (number of full clockwise turns of the opening thread of a gynaecological speculum) and area (defined by the size of the VD). Quality of life and pelvic floor (PF) functionality were also evaluated. There was no effect of the VD on vaginal length, width and area among the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. However, in the analysis stratified by adhesion, the CG had a significant decrease in the vaginal area. PF was predominantly hypoactive throughout the follow-up. Quality of life improved in both groups, but the reduction of constipation, vaginal dryness and stress urinary incontinence manifested only in the IG. The use of VD did not alter the dimensions of the vaginal canal within the first 3 months after the end of radiotherapy treatment. However, there was a large sample loss during follow-up so studies with a larger sample number and longer follow-up time need to be conducted.

To investigate whether a behavioral intervention strategy can produce a sustained increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary time among individuals with type 2 diabetes. The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study 2 was an open-label, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical superiority trial, with recruitment from October 2012 to February 2014 and follow-up until February 2017. In 3 outpatient diabetes clinics in Rome, 300 physically inactive and sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized 1:1 (stratified by center, age, and diabetes treatment) to receive a behavioral intervention or standard care for 3 years. All participants received usual care targeted to meet American Diabetes Association guideline recommendations. Participants in the behavioral intervention group (n = 150) received 1 individual theoretical counseling session and 8 individual biweekly theoretical and practical counseling sessions each year. Participants in the standard care group (n = 150) received only general physician recommendations. Co-primary end points were sustained change in physical activity volume, time spent in light-intensity and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, and sedentary time, measured by an accelerometer.

To our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated in a well-powered randomized clinical trial. To determine whether a clinical pathway-based, multifaceted QCI intervention could improve clinical outcomes among patients with ACS in resource-constrained hospitals in China. This large, stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted in nonpercutaneous coronary intervention hospitals across China and included all patients older than 18 years and with a final diagnosis of ACS who were recruited consecutively between October 2011 and December 2014. We excluded patients who died before or within 10 minutes of hospital arrival. We recruited 5768 and 0 eligible patients for the control and intervention groups, respectively, in step 1, 4326 and 1365 in step 2, 3278 and 3059 in step 3, 1419 and 4468 in step 4, and 0 and 5645 in step 5. The intervention included establishing a QCI team, training clinical staff, implementing ACS clinical pathways, sequential site performance assessment and feedback, online technical support, and patient education. The usual care was the control that was compared. The primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), comprising all-cause mortality, reinfarction/myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included 16 key performance indicators (KPIs) and the composite score developed from these KPIs. Of 29 346 patients (17 639 men [61%]; mean [SD] age for control, 64.1 [11.6] years; mean [SD] age for intervention, 63.9 [11.7] years) who were recruited from 101 hospitals, 14 809 (50.5%) were in the control period and 14 537 (49.5%) were in the intervention period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of in-hospital MACE between the intervention and control periods after adjusting for cluster and time effects (3.9% vs 4.4%; odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.15; P = .52). The intervention showed a significant improvement in the composite KPI score (mean [SD], 0.69 [0.22] vs 0.61 [0.23]; P < .01) and in 7 individual KPIs, including the early use of antiplatelet therapy and the use of appropriate secondary prevention medicines at discharge. No unexpected adverse events were reported. Among resource-constrained Chinese hospitals, introducing a multifaceted QCI intervention had no significant effect on in-hospital MACE, although it improved a few of the care process indicators of evidence-based ACS management.

Previous research has raised the question of whether a non-trauma-focused treatment can be as effective as trauma exposure therapy in reducing PTSD symptoms. This study aimed to compare the non-trauma-focused practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) with prolonged exposure therapy (PE) in a non-inferiority clinical trial, and to compare both therapies with a control of PTSD health education (HE). We did a randomised controlled trial at the Department of Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System in CA, USA. We included 203 veterans with a current diagnosis of PTSD resulting from active military service randomly assigned to a TM or PE group, or an active control group of HE, using stratified block randomisation. Each treatment provided 12 sessions over 12 weeks, with daily home practice. TM and HE were mainly given in a group setting and PE was given individually. The primary outcome was change in PTSD symptom severity over 3 months, assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Analysis was by intention to treat. We hypothesised that TM would show non-inferiority to PE in improvement of CAPS score (Δ=10), with TM and PE superior to PTSD HE. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865123. Between June 10, 2013, and Oct 7, 2016, 203 veterans were randomly assigned to an intervention group (68 to the TM group, 68 to the PE group, and 67 to the PTSD HE group). TM was significantly non-inferior to PE on change in CAPS score from baseline to 3-month post-test (difference between groups in mean change -5·9, 95% CI -14·3 to 2·4, p=0·0002). In standard superiority comparisons, significant reductions in CAPS scores were found for TM versus PTSD HE (-14·6 95% CI, -23·3 to -5·9, p=0·0009), and PE versus PTSD HE (-8·7 95% CI, -17·0 to -0·32, p=0·041). 61% of those receiving TM, 42% of those receiving PE, and 32% of those receiving HE showed clinically significant improvements on the CAPS score.

We conducted a prospective, unblinded, randomised, non-inferiority study comparing either 2 or 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy after surgical drainage of native joint bacterial arthritis in adults. Excluded were implant-related infections, episodes without surgical lavage and episodes with a follow-up of less than 2 months. We enrolled 154 cases: 77 in the 4-week arm and 77 in the 2-week arm. Median length of intravenous antibiotic treatment was 1 and 2 days, respectively. The median number of surgical lavages was 1 in both arms. Recurrence of infection was noted in three patients (2%): 1 in the 2-week arm (99% cure rate) and 2 in the 4-week arm (97% cure rate). There was no difference in the number of adverse events or sequelae between the study arms. Of the overall 154 arthritis cases, 99 concerned the hand and wrist, for which an additional subgroup analysis was performed. In this per-protocol subanalysis, we noted three recurrences: one in the 2-week arm (97 % cure); two in the 4-week arm (96 % cure) and witnessed sequelae in 50% in the 2-week arm versus 55% in the 4-week arm, of which five (13%) and six (13%) needed further interventions. After initial surgical lavage for septic arthritis, 2 weeks of targeted antibiotic therapy is not inferior to 4 weeks regarding cure rate, adverse events or sequelae and leads to a significantly shorter hospital stay, at least for hand and wrist arthritis.

This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adding sirolimus to the standard cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil prophylaxis therapy for preventing acute GVHD in this setting. This multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial took place at nine HSCT centres based in the USA, Denmark, and Germany. Eligible patients were diagnosed with advanced haematological malignancies treatable by allogeneic HSCT, had a Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 60, were aged older than 50 years, or if they were aged 50 years or younger, were considered at high risk of regimen-related toxicity associated with a high-dose pre-transplantation conditioning regimen. Patients were randomly allocated by an adaptive randomisation scheme stratified by transplantation centre to receive either the standard GVHD prophylaxis regimen (cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil) or the triple-drug combination regimen (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus). Patients and physicians were not masked to treatment. All patients were prepared for HSCT with fludarabine (30 mg/m  per day) 4, 3, and 2 days before receiving 2 or 3 Gy total body irradiation on the day of HSCT (day 0). In both study groups, 5·0 mg/kg of cyclosporine was administered orally twice daily starting 3 days before HSCT, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered from day 96 through to day 150. In the standard GVHD prophylaxis group, 15 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil was given orally three times daily from day 0 until day 30, then twice daily until day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. In the triple-drug group, mycophenolate mofetil doses were the same as in the standard group, but the drug was discontinued on day 40. Sirolimus was started 3 days before HSCT, taken orally at 2 mg once daily and adjusted to maintain trough concentrations between 3-12 ng/mL through to day 150, and (in the absence of GVHD) tapered off by day 180. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD at day 100 post-transplantation. Secondary endpoints were non-relapse mortality, overall survival, progression-free survival, cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD, and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD. Efficacy and safety analyses were per protocol, including all patients who received conditioning treatment and underwent transplantation. Toxic effects were measured according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18-65 years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376. Between September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation = four) and 853 participants to the intervention (n = 19 with 457 participants) or control group (n = 18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54·4%) intervention and 236 (59·6%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference = - 336, 95% CI: -612 to - 60, p = 0·02) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 2·97 h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p = 0·62), which could result in net savings ranging from £66 to £735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants. Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.

Self-efficacy theory guides the conceptual model underlying the FFW intervention. Some initial evidence has been provided for the efficacy of FFW to promote: well-being self-efficacy; interpersonal, community, psychological and economic subjective well-being; and, interpersonal and physical well-being actions. The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol for a new randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to provide the first investigation of the effectiveness of FFW to increase well-being and physical activity in adults with obesity in the United States of America. The study design is a large-scale, prospective, parallel group RCT. Approximately 9 hundred participants will be randomly assigned to the FFW or Usual Care (UC) group to achieve a 1:1 group (i.e. UC) assignment. Participants will be recruited through an online panel recruitment company. Data collection, including determination of eligibility, will be conducted online and enrollment is scheduled to begin on 8 August 2018. Data collection will occur at baseline, 30 days and 60 days after baseline. Instruments to measure demographic information, anthropometric characteristics, self-efficacy, physical activity and well-being will be included in the battery. Data will be modeled under an intent to treat approach and/or a complier average causal effect approach depending on the level of observed engagement with the intervention. The effectiveness trial described in this paper builds upon the 2015 FFW efficacy trial and has the potential to be important for at least three reasons. The first reason is based upon a general scientific approach that the potential utility of interventions should be evaluated under both ideal (e.g., more controlled) and real-world (e.g., less controlled) conditions. The second reason is based upon the global need for readily scalable online behavioral interventions that effectively promote physical activity in adults. The third reason is based upon the troubling global trend toward obesity along with evidence for obesity as a risk factor for several major non-communicable diseases.

randomized to eating meals containing farmed Atlantic salmon or meat three times weekly for 16 weeks,,,"Children (n = 205, age 4-6 years) in this trial were individually randomized to eating meals containing farmed Atlantic salmon or meat three times weekly for 16 weeks.",,,"Long chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (LC-PUFA) are of functional and structural importance for brain development. Observational studies have shown positive relations between fatty fish consumption and cognitive performance in children, but Results from intervention studies using supplementary n-3 LC-PUFA are conflicting. Salmon is a good source of n-3 LC-PUFA, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We tested the hypothesis that an increased dietary salmon intake results in better cognitive outcomes than a meat based diet. Children (n = 205, age 4-6 years) in this trial were individually randomized to eating meals containing farmed Atlantic salmon or meat three times weekly for 16 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention a cognitive test (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition, WPPSI-III) and a fine-motor coordination test (Nine Hole Peg Test, 9-HPT) were performed. Biochemical analyses included glycerophospholipid fatty acid profiles in plasma and cheek cells, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and urinary iodine concentration. Dietary intake before and during the study were determined using food frequency questionnaires. Intakes of EPA, DHA, vitamin D and iodine were higher in the salmon than the meat group, but on biomarker level only EPA and DHA increased significantly in the salmon group compared to the meat group (p < 0.001). In general linear models no significant differences between the intervention groups were found in the scale scores of the WPPSI-III tests and the 9-HPT. In analyses of the raw scores, the salmon group showed significantly better improvement in two of the eight raw scores compared to the meat group (symbol search p = 0.038, picture concepts p = 0.047). Intake of farmed Atlantic salmon led to a greater increase of the raw scores of the picture concept and symbol search subtests, while in the six other subtests raw scores were not different between the groups. This might indicate a modest positive association of salmon intake with the performance of preschool children in some subtests evaluating fluid intelligence but does not suggest an influence on global IQ development.

A 2 × 2 design with block randomization and double blinding for supplement or placebo was used. Subjects ingested EAA (15 g) or placebo daily. Exercising subjects participated in supervised progressive vigorous treadmill walking 3 times weekly. Measures of insulin sensitivity by oral glucose tolerance testing were collected at baseline and 22 weeks. Dietary intakes of protein and specific amino acids were determined in a subset of subjects. Overall, exercise improved insulin sensitivity, while EAA supplementation had no effect. In the dietary subset, post-intervention insulin sensitivity did not correlate significantly with the total intake of EAA, anti-angiogenic amino acids (cysteine, methionine), or branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine). Overall, we conclude that in healthy older adults with moderate protein intake, EAA supplementation is metabolically safe as it does not decrease insulin sensitivity regardless of its combination with aerobic exercise. Thus, daily protein intake should be controlled for when modeling insulin sensitivity. Future studies should explore the role of increased blood flow as a potential explanatory factor for the observed interaction between aerobic exercise and supplementation.

There was no significant difference in mean (SD) scores for postpartum depression between the intervention group (4.8 [3.7]) and the control group (5.4 [4.1]) (mean difference, -0.6; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.1). There was also no significant difference in rates of postpartum depression between the intervention group (12 of 192 [6.3%]) and the control group (36 of 387 [9.3%]) (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.33-1.28). Instrumental variable analysis indicated that noncompliance may have attenuated the effect estimates obtained in the primary analysis. Moderate-intensity exercise during pregnancy did not lead to significant reductions in postpartum depression. However, noncompliance to the intervention protocol was substantial and may have led to underestimations of the possible benefits of exercise. The point estimates for this study are in the same direction as the previous randomized clinical trial on this topic.

The secondary end point was quality of life as measured by the FACT-HN version 4 questionnaire at the end of 1 year follow-up. The mean number of lymph node harvested per patient was 25.6 (range 8-85). Of the 32 patients, 3 had histologically positive node in level Ib, one of these patients had single positive node while the remaining two had three positive nodes in level Ib. At median follow-up of 36 months disease-free survival in IIb, sparing group was 83% compared to 91% in control arm, the difference in survival between two groups was statistically not significant (p = 0.694). EMG of the shoulder showed denervation pattern in 45% patients undergoing IIb preserving surgery at 1 month follow-up compared to 95% in conventional surgery group, this recovered in all patients but one at 3 months and 100% recovery was seen at 6 months. The results of the present study indicate that superselective IIb preserving neck dissections are technically feasible and appear to be oncologically safe procedures when performed as elective prophylactic procedures in highly select group of patients. A significant number of occult metastasis seen in the present study suggests prophylactic dissection to be better than wait and watch policy. Results also show initial higher shoulder morbidity at 1 month in patients undergoing IIb preserving dissections; however, at the end of 1 year recovery is complete and both procedures are comparable.

Intravenous β-lactam antibiotics are considered to confer a high risk of C difficile infection because of their biliary excretion into the gastrointestinal tract and disruption of the gut microbiome. ribaxamase (SYN-004) is an orally administered β-lactamase that was designed to be given with intravenous β-lactam antibiotics to degrade excess antibiotics in the upper gastrointestinal tract before they disrupt the gut microbiome and lead to C difficile infection.

In this parallel-group, double-blind, multicentre, phase 2b, randomised placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients who had been admitted to a hospital with a lower respiratory tract infection with a pneumonia index score of 90-130 and who were expected to be treated with ceftriaxone for at least 5 days. Patients were recruited from 54 clinical sites in the USA, Canada, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Serbia.

Adverse events were similar between groups but more deaths were reported in the ribaxamase group (11 deaths vs five deaths in the placebo group). This disparity was due to the higher incidence of deaths attributed to cardiac-associated causes in the ribaxamase group (six deaths vs one death in the placebo group). In patients treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for lower respiratory tract infections, oral ribaxamase reduced the incidence of C difficile infections compared with placebo. The imbalance in deaths between the groups appeared to be related to the underlying health of the patients.

There were no major limb amputations in either group. The rates of all-cause (6.5% vs. 5.1%; p = 1.00) and cardiovascular-related (1.6% vs. 1.7%; p = 1.00) mortality were similar between groups. Functional improvements over baseline were sustained in both groups, with 60% fewer reinterventions in the DCB group. A sustained treatment effect is achievable with a low-dose DCB with an optimized coating formulation. This trial demonstrated for the first time a statistically significantly higher primary patency rate for a low-dose DCB versus PTA at 2 years.

The Family Access to a Dentist Study (FADS) evaluated the effectiveness of school interventions based on the common-sense model of self-regulation (CSM) among K-4 children needing restorative treatment. FADS was a multisite double-blind randomized controlled trial with 5 arms. FADS tested a CSM-driven referral letter and dental information guide (DIG) to move caregivers from inaccurate to accurate perceptions of dental caries. Six school districts from Ohio and Washington (14 schools) participated in school years 2015 to 2016 and 2016 to 2017. A total of 611 caregivers were randomized, and 86% ( n = 597 children) completed the exit examination. The primary outcome was receipt of care based on a change in oral health status determined clinically within 1 school year. In accordance with our primary aims, 5 arms were collapsed into 3: CSM letter and reduced CSM letter (combined), CSM letter + DIG and reduced CSM letter + reduced DIG (combined), and standard letter. Among all sites, 39.7% received restorative care (237 of 597). Combined analysis of sites revealed that the CSM referral letter (with and without the DIG) did not increase dental visits when compared with the standard letter. However, for combined sites (East Cleveland, Ohio; Washington), the CSM + DIG increased dental visits when compared with standard letter in univariate analysis (51.3% vs. 40.9%), indicating 1.6-times increased odds of a dental visit (95% CI, 0.97 to 2.58) after imputation and adjustment for covariates. The CSM + DIG group had 1.9-times increased odds (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.08) of care when compared the CSM letter alone. A CSM-driven approach to informing caregivers of the chronic nature of caries with resources in an illustrative manner can increase the benefit of school oral health screening (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02395120).

In this single-blind, individually randomised controlled trial, we recruited pregnant women aged 18 years or older who scored at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from antenatal clinics in Goa. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive enhanced usual care (EUC; so-called because, in India, perinatal depression is not typically treated) only (control group) or THPP in addition to EUC (intervention group) in randomly sized blocks that were stratified by area of residence (urban or rural). Group allocations were concealed from participants and researchers before assignments were made by use of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcomes were the severity of depressive symptoms (assessed by PHQ-9 score) and the prevalence of remission (defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5) in participants with available data 6 months after childbirth, which was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocations.

Significant delays have occurred during previous introductions of new guidelines into routine clinical practice in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We therefore examined whether providing enhanced audit and feedback as opposed to routine standard feedback might accelerate adoption of the new pneumonia guidelines by clinical teams within hospitals in a low-income setting. In this parallel group cluster randomized controlled trial, 12 hospitals were assigned to either enhanced feedback (n = 6 hospitals) or standard feedback (n = 6 hospitals) using restricted randomization. The standard (network) intervention delivered in both trial arms included support to improve collection and quality of patient data, provision of mentorship and team management training for pediatricians, peer-to-peer networking (meetings and social media), and multimodal (print, electronic) bimonthly hospital specific feedback reports on multiple indicators of evidence guideline adherence. In addition to this network intervention, the enhanced feedback group received a monthly hospital-specific feedback sheet targeting pneumonia indicators presented in multiple formats (graphical and text) linked to explicit performance goals and action plans and specific email follow up from a network coordinator. At the start of the trial, all hospitals received a standardized training on the new guidelines and printed booklets containing pneumonia treatment protocols. The primary outcome was the proportion of children admitted with indrawing and/or fast-breathing pneumonia who were correctly classified using new guidelines and received correct antibiotic treatment (oral amoxicillin) in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome was the proportion of correctly classified and treated children for whom clinicians changed treatment from oral amoxicillin to injectable antibiotics. The trial included 2299 childhood pneumonia admissions, 1087 within the hospitals randomized to enhanced feedback intervention, and 1212 to standard feedback. The proportion of children who were correctly classified and treated in the first 24 h during the entire 9-month period was 38.2% (393 out of 1030) and 38.4% (410 out of 1068) in the enhanced feedback and standard feedback groups, respectively (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-3.34; P = 0.855). However, in exploratory analyses, there was evidence of an interaction between type of feedback and duration (in months) since commencement of intervention, suggesting a difference in adoption of pneumonia policy over time in the enhanced compared to standard feedback arm (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.36, P < 0.001). Enhanced feedback comprising increased frequency, clear messaging aligned with goal setting, and outreach from a coordinator did not lead to a significant overall effect on correct pneumonia classification and treatment during the 9-month trial. There appeared to be a significant effect of time (representing cumulative effect of feedback cycles) on adoption of the new policy in the enhanced feedback compared to standard feedback group.
