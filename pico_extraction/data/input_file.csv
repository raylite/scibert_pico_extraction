30680237,"In order to investigate the efficacy and safety of Afalaza in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) at risk of progression, this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was performed. Derived by technological treatment of antibodies to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOs), Afalaza was previously proved to modulate its molecular targets. The mechanism of action of the drug is associated with the modulating effect of the antibiodies (RA-Abs) on the molecular targets (PSA and eNOS) by way of conformational changes. A total of 49 patients aged 45-60 years with BPH and moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), total prostate volume (TPV) ≥30 cm , Qmax 10-15 ml/s, and serum PSA<4 ng/ml were randomly assigned to receive either Afalaza (n = 125) or placebo (n = 124) for 12 months. Changes in BPH/LUTS symptoms (according to the International Prostate Symptom Score), Qmax, TPV, PSA, BPH clinical progression, occurrence of acure urinary retention (AUR) events or BPH-related surgery were estimated as the study endpoints. IPSS mean change was -3.7 ±3.0 (95% CI -4.3 to -3.2) after 12 months of Afalaza (vs. -2.9 ±2.4; 95% CI -3.3 to -2.4 in placebo; р = 0.02). Qmax growth was 2.5 ±4.3 ml/s (vs. 1.4 ±3.3 in placebo; p = 0.049), TPV reduced by 11.8 ±16.0% (vs. 6.5 ±14.7%; p = 0.01, and PSA remained unchanged. Afalaza therapy resulted in a significant decrease in the total sum of BPH progression symptoms (p = 0.01). The maximum effect of Afalaza was registered after 12 months without a tendency to form a 'plateau'. During the study, no patients experienced AUR or BPH-related surgery. A 12-month course of Afalaza therapy is effective and safe for patients with BPH. The results of end points measurements revealed asignificant advantage of Afalaza compared to placebo in the overall symptoms benefit and a decline in the risk of BPH progression.",,,,,,,
30591073,"Despite the high prevalence of insomnia in patients with advanced cancer, there are no randomized controlled trials on pharmacological interventions for insomnia in this group of patients. A variety of pharmacological agents is recommended to manage sleep disturbance for insomnia in the general population, but their efficacy and safety in adults with advanced cancer are not established. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of medications for insomnia in order to improve the evidence in patients with advanced cancer. One of the most used sleep medications at present in patients with cancer is zopiclone. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial. A total of 100 patients with metastatic cancer who report insomnia will be randomly allocated to zopiclone or placebo. The treatment duration with zopiclone/placebo is 6 consecutive nights. The primary endpoint is patient-reported sleep quality during the final study night (night 6) assessed on a numerical rating scale of 0-10, where 0 = Best sleep and 10 = Worst possible sleep. Secondary endpoints include the mean patient-reported total sleep time and sleep onset latency during the final study night (night 6). Results from this study on treatment of insomnia in advanced cancer will contribute to clinical decision-making and improve the treatment of sleep disturbance in this patient cohort.",,,,,,,
30940189,"The benefit of systemic treatments in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) which has progressed after chemotherapy is still uncertain and optimal regimens based on randomized trials have not yet been established. We aimed to compare the efficacy of irinotecan plus S-1 with S-1 monotherapy in recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients who had resistance to platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy. We conducted a prospective randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial in 15 centers across China. Eligible patients were adults with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic ESCC, and were randomly assigned (ratio, 1:1) to receive either irinotecan plus S-1 (intravenous infusion of irinotecan [160 mg/m ] on day 1 and oral S-1 [80-120 mg] on days 1-10, repeated every 14 days) or oral S-1 monotherapy (80-120 mg/day on days 1-14, repeated every 21 days) using a central computerized minimization procedure. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Between December 23, 2014 and July 25, 2016, we screened 148 patients and randomly assigned 123 patients to receive either irinotecan plus S-1 regimen (n = 61) or S-1 monotherapy (n = 62). After a median follow-up of 29.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.5-40.9 months), the median PFS was significantly longer in the irinotecan plus S-1 group than in the S-1 monotherapy group (3.8 months [95% CI 2.9-4.3 months] vs. 1.7 months [95% CI 1.4-2.7 months], hazard ratio = 0.58, 95% CI 0.38-0.86, P = 0.006). The objective response rates were 24.6% in the irinotecan plus S-1 group and 9.7% in the S-1 monotherapy group (P = 0.002). The patients in the irinotecan plus S-1 group presented with increased rates of grade 3-4 leukopenia (16.4% vs. 0%), neutropenia (14.8% vs. 1.6%), and nausea (4.9% vs. 0%). No significant difference in grade 3-4 diarrhea and no treatment-related deaths were observed in both groups. The combination of irinotecan with S-1 was similarly tolerable but significantly prolonged PFS compared to S-1 monotherapy as a second- or third-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC.

30843421,"To evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) for the treatment of anxiety and depression in unmarried patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial. A prospective pilot randomised controlled trial of unmarried women with PCOS was conducted from November 2012 to March 2016. Participants were assigned to the acupuncture group (receiving EA for 16 weeks) or the control group (receiving sham acupuncture for 16 weeks), with 27 patients in each group. The pre-specified primary outcomes and all secondary outcomes, with the exception of serum levels of neurotransmitters including norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (AD), serotonin (5-HT) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), will be reported separately. Additional outcome measures selected for this secondary analysis included anxiety and depression scale scores (Zung-SAS and Zung-SDS), 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) scale scores, PCOS Quality of Life (PCOSQOL) scale scores and Chinese Quality of Life (CHQOL) scale scores. After the16-week intervention, an increase in serum NE and reduction in 5-HT were observed in the acupuncture group (P=0.028 and P=0.023, respectively). The serum level of GABA decreased in both groups after the interventions (both P<0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in the levels of any neurotransmitters (p>0.05). After EA treatment, SAS and SDS scores were decreased in the acupuncture group (P=0.007 and P=0.027, respectively) and were lower than those of the control group (P=0.003 and P=0.004, respectively). The SF-36 domain scores for mental health, vitality, social functioning, general health and health transition, the total CHQOL scores, and the infertility problems and body hair domains of the PCOSQOL improved significantly after EA (P<0.05). EA appears to improve symptoms of anxiety/depression and quality of life in PCOS patients and may influence serum levels of NE and 5-HT. These findings should be interpreted with caution, given the secondary nature of the outcome measures reported herein. ",,,,,,,
30856652,"Hashimoto disease is a chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. Despite adequate hormone substitution, some patients have persistent symptoms that may be the result of immunologic pathophysiology. To determine whether thyroidectomy improves symptoms in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis who still have symptoms despite having normal thyroid gland function while receiving medical therapy. Randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02319538). Secondary care hospital in Norway. 150 patients aged 18 to 79 years with persistent Hashimoto-related symptoms despite euthyroid status while receiving hormone replacement therapy and with serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody titers greater than 1000 IU/mL. Total thyroidectomy or medical management with hormone substitution to secure euthyroid status in both groups. The primary outcome was general health score on the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) at 18 months. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects of surgery, the other 7 SF-36 subscores, fatigue questionnaire scores, and serum anti-TPO antibody titers at 6, 12, and 18 months. During follow-up, only the surgical group demonstrated improvement: Mean general health score increased from 38 to 64 points, for a between-group difference of 29 points (95% CI, 22 to 35 points) at 18 months. Fatigue score decreased from 23 to 14 points, for a between-group difference of 9.3 points (CI, 7.4 to 11.2 points). Chronic fatigue frequency decreased from 82% to 35%, for a between-group difference of 39 percentage points (CI, 23 to 53 percentage points). Median serum anti-TPO antibody titers decreased from 2232 to 152 IU/mL, for a between-group difference of 1148 IU/mL (CI, 1080 to 1304 IU/mL). In multivariable regression analyses, the adjusted treatment effects remained similar to the unadjusted effects. Results are applicable only to a subgroup of patients with Hashimoto disease, and follow-up was limited to 18 months. Total thyroidectomy improved health-related quality of life and fatigue, whereas medical therapy did not. This improvement, along with concomitant elimination of serum anti-TPO antibodies, may elucidate disease mechanisms. Telemark Hospital.",,,,,,,
